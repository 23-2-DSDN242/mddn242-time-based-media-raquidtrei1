Begin work on maeda clock task, I have decided to recreate 7th clock where AM/PM is centered, whereas the actual time behaves like a clock hand.

18/07/2023
I finished a prototype for my clock, this only runs on the minute hand. In order to add points to a circle I used code from this webpage:
https://www.alpharithms.com/evenly-spacing-objects-around-a-circle-in-p5js-processing-180222/
The movement of the points however, I did by myself.
